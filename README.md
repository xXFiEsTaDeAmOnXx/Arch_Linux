# My Arch Linux installation script

This repository includes the [instruction](install.sh) to install my arch linux setup.

These are some Features I use:
==============================
 - Btrfs
 - snapper for snapshots
 - multiple kernels
 - grub bootloader
 - envy control
 - rsync to backup the efi partion
 - zram

Display Manager and Desktop Environment 
=======================================
I use gdm as display manager with gnome as desktop environment. As window manager i typically use wayland, eventhough I sometimes need to switch x11, because of my nvidia grafics.
